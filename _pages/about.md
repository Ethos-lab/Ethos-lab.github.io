Welcome to Ethos Lab, led by [Prof. Amir Rahmati](https://amir.rahmati.com) Here, we focus on improving the security of emerging technologies, such as Internet of Things (IoT) devices and Cyber-Physical systems. Our work involves designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. As we move towards a world where many resource- and energy-limited devices have access to our data & activities, our research creates an avenue for these devices to incorporate security in their design. You can find our publications [here]().
