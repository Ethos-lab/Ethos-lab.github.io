Welcome to Ethos Lab, led by [Prof. Amir Rahmati](https://amir.rahmati.com) Here, we focus on improving the security of emerging technologies, including IoT, ML, and AR systems. Our work involves designing, building, and evaluating systems that tackle security challenges in these domains. As we move towards a world where many resource- and energy-limited devices have access to our data & activities, our research creates an avenue for these devices to incorporate security in their design. You can find our publications [here](/publications/).
